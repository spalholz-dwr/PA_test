!Three types of water are delivered through the NBA:
!	- SWP water (suffix _prj)
!	- Settlement water (suffix _smt)

! Fairfield, Vacaville and Benecia Agreement for Settlement Water
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/*
Settlement Water is a major source of water for the cities of Benicia, Fairfield and Vacaville. In
1990 the three cities filed for State Water Resources Control Board water rights permits for an
appropriation of water under the State’s Watershed of Origin statues. The permit application was
withdrawn after a settlement was reached with DWR that provided an essentially equivalent water
supply from the SWP. A Settlement Agreement and a Conveyance Agreement with DWR specify
the details of the Settlement Water supply.
Settlement Water is available up to the following amounts: Benicia 10,500 AF/year;
Fairfield 11,800 AF/year; and Vacaville 9,320 AF/year. The main restriction to Settlement water is
that is in not available when Standard Water Right Term 91 is in effect.

! Vallejo Permit Water
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/*
VPW is derived from a water rights license held by Vallejo. The license allows for 31.52
cfs to be pumped from the Delta. The service area allowed to use VPW includes Vallejo, Benicia,
parts of Fairfield and the American Canyon area of Napa County. Prior to the construction of the
NBA, VPW was transported in the Cache Slough pipeline owned by Vallejo. A pumping plant
located on Cache Slough in the Delta pumped water to Vallejo through an underground pipeline.
The Cache Slough Pipeline is interconnected with the NBA and portions of the Cache
Slough Pipeline are still being used to transport water from the NBA.
When the NBA was constructed, Vallejo paid for the right to use the NBA to deliver VPW
through the NBA. The NBA was increased in size to transport 31.52 cfs of VPW. Annual amounts
of VPW are contractually limited to 17,287 AF per year by DWR. This amount is 5,493 AF less
than the amount if the 31.52 cfs were taken all year round. An amendment to the agreement with
DWR would be necessary to increase the amount of VPW to the maximum amount.
VPW has a higher water rights priority date than the SWP and CVP, so it is more reliable
than SWP supplies. Term 91 is not included in the VPW license. 

Particularly in dry years, VPW is an important part of the water supply in Solano County.
Vallejo exchanges and sells VPW to other cities to augment their supplies.
