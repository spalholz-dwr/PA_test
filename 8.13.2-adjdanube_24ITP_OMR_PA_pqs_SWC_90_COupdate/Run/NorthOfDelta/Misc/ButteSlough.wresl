! Todo: Refine Butte Slough Outfall gate operations
! The Butte Slough Outfall Gates are configured as a culvert through the levee with a one-way (flap) gate on the Sacramento River end.
! When the Sacramento River surface elevation is higher than Butte Creekâ€™s surface elevation, the flap remains shut,
! preventing outflow to the Sacramento River, and forcing 100% of the Butte Creek flow through Butte Slough
