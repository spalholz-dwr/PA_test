/*
Clear Lake is a natural lake with an approximate area of 44,0000 acres when full and a maximum depth of approximately 50 feet.
Water level fluctuations were modified by the construction of the Cache Creek Dam in 1914.
From 1915 until present, the levels of Clear Lake have been manipulated by operation of the Cache Creek Dam.

Zero on the Rumsey gage (which is located at Lakeport)
is regarded as the natural rim of the lake when water ceases to flow into Cache Creek.
An elevation of 7.56 feet on the Rumsey Gage is considered a "full" lake
with an active storage of 313,000 acre-feet.

/*
Summer operation of Clear Lake are governed by the Solano Decree (1978, modified 1995). The decree specifies how much water is available for use by Yolo County FCWCD,
and how much water is available in each month of the summer. If Clear Lake is full (7.56 feet Rumsey) on May 1, 150,000 acre-feet of water is available to Yolo.
On Clear Lake, 150,000 acre-feet amounts to approximately 3 1/2 feet. If Clear Lake is below 3.22 feet Rumsey on May 1, no water is available to Yolo for release.
An additional 3 feet of water evaporates from the surface during the summer months, therefore, Clear Lake can drop from 3 to 6 1/2 feet in any given summer.
On the average, Clear Lake fluctuates 5.6 feet each year.

The adjusted May 1 lake level determines the allowable withdrawal by Yolo County FCWCD.
Irrigation withdrawals in April are added to the May 1 lake level to determine the allowable withdrawal for the year.
Flood releases required by the Gopcevic Decree (1920) are not counted as part of the annual allotment.
The following table summarizes the allowable withdrawal based on the adjusted May 1 lake level:

 Adjusted	Lake		Allowable  
 May 1		Storage		Seasonal
 Level				Withdrawal

3.22 		130,000		       0
3.50		141,770		   7,847
4.00		162,390		  21,593
4.50		183,135		  35,423
5.00		204,030		  49,353 
5.50		225,105		  63,403
6.00		246,350		  83,350
6.50		267,785		 104,785
7.00		289,400		.126,400
7.56		313,000		.150,000
 
The maximum withdrawal is 150,000 acre-feet. If the stage of Clear Lake is 3.22 feet or less in the Rumsey gage on May 1, the District may not withdraw
any water to deliver below the Cache Creek Dam for that season (October 31).

/*
The seasonal withdrawal may only be made between April 1 and October 31.
Only flood releases required by the Gopcevic Decree are allowed between November 1 and March 31.
In order to balance the needs for recreation on Clear Lake and water use within Yolo County, withdrawals are limited by month to a maximum
of the following percentages of the total withdrawal for each month:

Month		Percent
April		 7.0
May		18.6
June		20.6
July		21.0
August		19.9
September	10.5
October		 2.4


Withdrawals during any month, except October, may exceed that month's withdrawal by 10 percent or 1,000 acre-feet, whichever is greater.
Such excess withdrawal is deducted from the allowable withdrawal for the next month. In addition, the October monthly withdrawal may be taken in any given month
without affecting the following month's scheduled withdrawal. 

In addition to the maximum amount withdrawn, monthly minimum water levels must be maintained. These limitations are based on the adjusted May 1 lake level.
If the adjusted May 1 lake level is above 7.56 feet Rumsey, the lake may not be drawn below 1.25 feet Rumsey on October 31.
If the adjusted May 1 lake level is below 3.75 feet Rumsey, the lake may not be drawn below 0.12 feet Rumsey on October 31.
With summer evaporation form the lake at approximately 3 feet, it is possible for the lake to drop below Zero Rumsey when the lake fills to less than 3 feet Rumsey,
even though no water is withdrawn from the lake.

/*
The Gopcevic Decree required the development of an operation schedule for the Cache Creek Dam on Cache Creek. Yolo County FCWCD
must operate the Cache Creek Dam in accordance with the schedule. The Operation Schedule identifies lake levels for different times during
the winter to which Clear Lake is allowed to fill. When the actual lake level is below the level indicated in the schedule, no water is allowed to be
released at the dam. Should the actual lake level rise above the level indicated in the schedule, the gates in the dam must be opened to lower the
lake level. As the actual lake level approaches the level indicated in the schedule for that date, conditions are taken into account so that the dam
operation will minimize flooding, while allowing the lake to fill to 7.56 Rumsey. 

Dec 31: 5.50 feet = 1,067.105
Jan 31: 6.55 feet = 1,111.938
Feb 28: 7.32 feet = 1,145.322
Mar 31: 7.56 feet = 1,155.826

The decree specifies that water must be released from Clear Lake Dam in the summer months so that lake elevations not exceed the following percentages
of the actual level on April 15 of each year:

May 1:	97% of April 15 stage
Jun 1: 	89% of April 15 stage
Jul 1: 	79% of April 15 stage
Aug 1: 	69% of April 15 stage
Sep 1:	58% of April 15 stage

To code this a line of least squares was drawn through the stage-capacity relationship, where the capacity is the active storage above a stage of 7.56 feet:

Storage - 842 = 41,163 * Stage
i.e. zero on Rumsey gage = 842 TAF
