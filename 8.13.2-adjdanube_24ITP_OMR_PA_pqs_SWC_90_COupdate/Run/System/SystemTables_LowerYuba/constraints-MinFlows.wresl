! Article 33 of the 1963 FERC license specifies minimum streamflow for the Middle Yuba below Hour House Dam,
! Oregon Creek below Log Cabin Diversion Dam, and North Yuba below New Colgate Diversion.

For the Oregon Creek and Middle Yuba diversions, the diversion is generally left open, with min. flow set through
the low level/fish outlets. The Our House Middle Yuba diversion acts as “primary” since it will force Oregon Creek
flows to spill the Log Cabin diversion if it is more than the physical capacity of Camptonville tunnel.

Also because the diversions are not operated in coordination with NBB releases under the current FERC license,
the diversion occurs no matter what is happening at NBB, even spill.
